        <p>Fluffy, layered, delicious buttermilk biscuits.  Easy to make and freeze well, enjoy with butter and jelly or honey.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 stick of butter</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>2 tbsp baking powder</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups flour (all purpose)</li>
            <li>1 cup and 3 tbsp buttermilk</li>
            <li>2 tsp honey or sugar (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note on buttermilk: cultured whole fat is ideal, but in a pinch any dairy milk with a couple tbsp of white vinegar mixed in and left to curdle for 10 minutes works as well.</p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 &deg;F</li>
            <li>Mix together dry ingredients in medium bowl</li>
            <li>Cut cold butter into half to quarter inch cubes</li>
            <li>Using your hands or a pastry cutter smush the butter into the dry mixture until there are little clumps the size of peas (over mixing is worse than under mixing)</li>
            <li>Pour one cup of buttermilk into the bowl with the dry buttery mixture and stir until just combined.  Add more buttermilk as needed to get everything into one shaggy ball</li>
            <li>Dump onto counter and pat into a rectangle that is about an inch thick</li>
            <li>Cut the rectangle in half and stack two pieces on top of each other.  Repeat process 3-4 times</li>
            <li>Cut biscuits into desired size/shape (I go for about 2 inch squares because it's easy)</li>
            <li>Place biscuits on parchment paper covered baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes or until tops are golden brown</li>
        </ol>
